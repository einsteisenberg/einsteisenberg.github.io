<p>\(\tau_N = \tau_0 \text{e}^{KV_c/\text{k}_\text{B}T} \tag{2}\)</p>

<p>where \(K\) is the anisotropy constant and \(V_c\) is volume of the magnetic
nanoparticle. \(\tau_0\) is given by:</p>

\[\tau_0 = \frac{\mu}{2\gamma \text{k}_\text{B} T}\frac{1+\alpha^2}{\alpha} \tag{3}\]

<p>where \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron, \(\mu\) is the magnetic
moment of the magnetic nanoparticle, and \(\alpha\) is a dimensionless damping
parameter.</p>
