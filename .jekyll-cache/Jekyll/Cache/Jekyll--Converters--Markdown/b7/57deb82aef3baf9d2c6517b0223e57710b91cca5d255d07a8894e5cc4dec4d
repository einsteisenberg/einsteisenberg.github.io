<h2 id="brief-explanation">Brief Explanation</h2>
<p>Every day I read. Every day I forget. In order to combat this vicious cycle of
read, forget, repeat, I am writing down what I read in my personal notebook…
the day after reading. This helps me learn what I read (writing down
explanations) as well as store the information into memory (write the day after).
Every week I will pick one interesting (completely subjective) thing I learned and
share it online for the world to see. This is the first of such posts. Please
be gentle.</p>

<h2 id="relaxation-of-magnetic-nano-particles">Relaxation of Magnetic Nano-Particles</h2>
<p>This week’s topic focusses on Brownian and Neel relaxation of magnetic nanoparticles.
When I say relaxation I mean a relaxation of the magnetic dipole moment. If I make
a strong magnetic field near the particles the dipole moments will align with the
magnetic field. After I switch off the field the dipoles moments do not stay fixed.
They decay so if I were to measure the magnetic moment some time later, it would
be less than before (for those who know: these particles are assumed to be
superparamagnetic). There are two mechanisms which cause the decay of the magnetic
moment.</p>

<h3 id="brownian-relaxation">Brownian Relaxation</h3>
<p>Brownian relaxation occurs due to the Brownian motion of the magnetic nanoparticle
(pretty self-explanatory). Normally the magnetic nanoparticle is contained within
a “yolk”. When this yolk moves around in a fluid it bumps other particles, causing
it to rotate in a random direction. The relaxation time of Brownian motion is given by
the following equation:</p>

\[\tau = \frac{3\eta V_h}{\text{k}_\text{B} T} \tag{1}\]

<p>where \(\eta\) is the viscosity of the fluid and \(V_h\) is the volume of the yolk.</p>

<h3 id="neel-relaxation">Neel Relaxation</h3>
<p>Neel relaxation occurs due to the thermalization of the dipole moment itself; it flips
between two stable orienations due to thermal energy from the surrounding system.
The relaxation time for Neel relaxation is given by the following equation:</p>

\[\tau_N = \tau_0 \text{e}^{KV_c/\text{k}_\text{B}T} \tag{2}\]

<p>where \(K\) is the anisotropy constant and \(V_c\) is volume of the magnetic
nanoparticle. \(\tau_0\) is given by:</p>

\[\tau_0 = \frac{\mu}{2\gamma \text{k}_\text{B} T}\frac{1+\alpha^2}{\alpha} \tag{3}\]

<p>where \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron, \(\mu\) is the magnetic
moment of the magnetic nanoparticle, and \(\alpha\) is a dimensionless damping
parameter.</p>

Hopefully soon I will have a post about the governing equations. Till next time!</p>
