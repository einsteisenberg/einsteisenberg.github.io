I"<h2 id="brief-explanation">Brief Explanation</h2>
<p>Every day I read. Every day I forget. In order to combat this vicious cycle of
read, forget, repeat, I am writing down what I read in my personal notebookâ€¦
the day after reading. This helps me learn what I read (writing down
explanations) as well as store the information into memory (write the day after).
Every week I will pick one interesting (completely subjective) thing I learned and
share it online for the world to see. This is the first of such posts. Please
be gentle.</p>
