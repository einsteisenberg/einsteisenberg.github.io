About Me
---------
Currently I am a PhD student studying quantum sensing, specifically using NV centers as magnetic sensors.

About this webpage
---------
The idea for a personal website was not abrupt. For many years I thought about the possibility of having a webpage, but never contemplated what I would put in my little corner of the internet.

The purpose for a webpage revealed itself when I entered my first year of grad school. When the IT admins were taking photos of the incoming students for the online directory, they asked us if we wanted personal websites linked. Non of us had one and the admins advised, "You guys should have a webpage, it will allow people to find you and your work." However, as a green graduate student, there wasn't a lot of professional work to brag about. Personal websites were for professors who wanted to create an online pamphlet for their research groups and to list their publications. In addition, I saw fellow grad students who DID have websites make uninspired blogs in which posts were a scarcity.

But the thought of a website floated around in my head, refusing to fade into the void of forgotten ideas. The thought lingered and was emphasized by the blogs that I read for help and entertainment. Python blogs helped me with simple coding issues I was having. Physics blogs became a fad and more people began writing about physics for non-physicists. The exposure to these types of blogs made me think, "If a personal website doesn't serve me directly, maybe I can provide a service for others by writing a physics blog."

Despite this realization, my personal website continued to exist only in theory. How could I choose what to write about that could help others? How could I guarantee that I wouldn't look stupid? I was paralyzed with fear of how my website would be perceived.

It wasn't until recently that I realized that maybe my website should be none of the things I previously thought. Writing and explanation are a useful tool for learning, but there isn't a rule about sharing. I could write for myself and if others wanted to read, then good on them.

This is my current mindset. I want to write about things I like because I enjoy talking about my interests. I want to be able to take what I am thinking about and turn those thoughts into something more tangible. And thus the website was born.
