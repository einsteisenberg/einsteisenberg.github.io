### Neel Relaxation
$$\tau_N = \tau_0 \text{e}^{KV_c/\text{k}_\text{B}T} \tag{2}$$

where $$K$$ is the anisotropy constant and $$V_c$$ is volume of the magnetic
nanoparticle. $$\tau_0$$ is given by:

$$ \tau_0 = \frac{\mu}{2\gamma \text{k}_\text{B} T}\frac{1+\alpha^2}{\alpha} \tag{3} $$

where $$\gamma$$ is the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron, $$ \mu$$ is the magnetic
moment of the magnetic nanoparticle, and $$\alpha$$ is a dimensionless damping
parameter.
